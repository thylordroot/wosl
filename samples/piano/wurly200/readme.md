# Synopsis

This sample collection represents the Wurlitzer 200A.

## Extended Description

The Wurlitzer 200A is an electric piano that works by hammering metal reeds;
it is known for its pleasingly harsh sound and iconic vibrato. It is known
to have been used in classic jazz, fusion, and rock. Its sound is distinctive
and malleable. In addition to a volume knob, the 200A also has a vibrato knob.
For convenience, samples wiht no vibrato ("clean") and with full vibrato are
recorded.

Note that the sampled are recorded for A=220Hz, not A=440Hz. This is because
the A above middle C is improperly tuned on the instrument in question. If
demand requires it, it will be rerecorded in 440Hz.
