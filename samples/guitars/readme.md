# Synopsis
This category contains sample collections for guitars and related 
instruments such as the vihuela de mano.

## Extended Description

This category includes any instrument which can be categorized as a guitar or
a close descendent. It does *not* include lutes, mandolins, or the like. It 
also does not include bass guitars, which are similar but merit a category of
their own. There are many variants of guitar; except where otherwise stated, a
6-string guitar is implied. It also assumes standard tuning for that instrument.

## Naming Conventions

The following playing methods are supported:

|Name |Description                         |
|-----|------------------------------------|
|pick |Single string, plectrum or hard pick|
|fpick|Single string, finger picked        |
|harm |Single string, harmonic at 12th fret|
|slap |Single string, slapped (like a bass)|

The guitar can be a very percussive instrument and a number of unpitched playing
methods exist for it:

|Name    |Description                       |
|mutechrd|Chord of strings muted at the neck|
|bodyhtom|High-pitched tambura (near neck)  |
|bodykick|Low-pitched tambura (near bridge) |

The following additional pitches are defined:

|Name|Description            |
|----|-----------------------|
|eh  |High E string (329.6Hz)|
|b   |B string (246.9Hz)     |
|g   |G string (196Hz)       |
|d	 |D string (146.8Hz)     |
|a   |A string (110 Hz)      |
|el  |Low E string (82.41Hz) |

Individual sample collections may refine these as needed. Usage of the name
"e" is discouraged because of its ambiguity.

The following names have special meaning within that directory:
