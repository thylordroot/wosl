# Synopsis

This sample collection represents primitive synthesizer waveforms.

## Extended Description

This sample collection contains various primitive waveforms that can be plugged
into most samplers. They are procedurally generated and are made to represent
one frame, as they are highly repetitious. The major exception to this is the
noise waveform, which contains 400 frames (about a second) of noise. This is
needed for variation. Generally speaking, you should use forward looping on
these samples.

## Naming Conventions

The following playing methods are supported:
