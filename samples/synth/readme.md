# Synopsis
This category includes snythesized instruments, including primitive waveforms
and theremins.

## Extended Description

This category is very broad, but is a catch-all for eletronic instruments such
as function generators, theremins, clean output from various sound chips, and
the like. Many of the sample collections here are either primitive waveforms or
sounds that are very difficult to properly model. In particular, the *prim*
collection is of interest and contains many basic waveforms that represent
synthesizers.

Nonetheless, care should be taken to ensure that this category does not grow too
broad by contributors. There is potential for this category to grow explosively,
so when possible, programmatic means should be used to generate samples instead.

## Naming Conventions

None.
