# Synopsis
This category includes instruments that are descended from the viheula de arco,
such as violins and the viola da gamba. 

## Extended Description

This category describes a category of instruments which are typically bowed,
such as the violin. There are many instruments which fall into this category
and some which would seem related. This category is only for insturments of
the European vintage, including the following:

- Members of the violin family, such as the violin, viola, cello, and double
 bass
- Members of the viol family, such as the viola da gamba
- Esoteric or related instruments like the nyckelharpa, hardanger fiddle, 
 l√•tfiol, kontra, or other related instrument.
 
Some instruments fall outside of this tradition and should be placed elsewhere.
For instance, the erhu, dan nhi, and rebab are all bowed instruments, but are
not considered viols for the purposes of this category.
