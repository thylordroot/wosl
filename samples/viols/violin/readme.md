# Synopsis

This sample collection represents a generic, acoustic violin.
## Extended Description

This sample collection contains various samples of a violin. Specific details
concerning the recording parameters are listed below, but the musician should
assume that it does not refer to any make of violin in particular. It is in
standard tuning and is played with some degree of competence.

Of course, the contributor of this sample is *not* a competent player and has
a student violin (specifically, a Medini MV300). The samples in this collection
should probably be replaced by somebody who knows what they're doing, but until
then, this sample is here to bootstrap this category. It is recorded through a
Shure SM58 using a Behringer Xenyx 802 mixer.

## Naming Conventions

None.
